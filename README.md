## Project Overview

This project contains a single-page interactive website, asking users if Lionel Messi is the best in football. Users are invited to click "Yes" or attempt to click "No," which humorously avoids clicks by moving to a random location on hover. If "Yes" is clicked, a welcoming message is displayed alongside a celebratory GIF.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button avoids the user by moving to a new location each time they hover over it. The "Yes" button grows in size with each interaction.
- **Dynamic Content Change**: On clicking "Yes," the main content is replaced with a welcoming message and an accompanying GIF.
- **Responsive and Playful Design**: Layout and styling are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/messi-fan-club.git
    cd messi-fan-club
    ```

2. **Open in Browser**:
    Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the page.

## File Descriptions

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file, containing the structure of the web page, including headings, images, and button elements.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file styles the page with colors, fonts, and button animations to create an engaging look and feel.
- **`main.js`**: The JavaScript file handles the functionality for the button interactions. It controls the movement of the "No" button on hover, dynamically adjusts the size of the "Yes" button, and shows a welcome message when "Yes" is clicked.
